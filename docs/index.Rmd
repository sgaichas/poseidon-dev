These pages document initial testing of the atlantisom package in development at https://github.com/r4atlantis/atlantisom using three different [Atlantis](https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/) output datasets. Development of atlantisom began at the [2015 Atlantis Summit](https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/atlantis-summit/) in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

Do we see ever small fish for large species? Is this normal, or a problem with length estimation?

May 16: Isaac says CCA fish look reasonable. NOBA Greenland halibut growth parameterization was reportedly "a nightmare" with conflicting science and datasets, so maybe we don't worry too much about them right now.

### True age compositions

<a href="https://sgaichas.github.io/poseidon-dev/FullBoccaccioTruthEx.html" target="_blank">Initial testing of true age functions, now running but output still wrong - May 24, 2019, updated May 27, 2019</a>

<a href="https://sgaichas.github.io/poseidon-dev/TestCalcZ.html" target="_blank">Test Z calc and compare with true annage NOBA - May 24, 2019</a>

May 24: Either `calc_Z` or `calc_stage2age` or both are incorrect if we expect them to exactly match atlantis annual age ouput where it is available. We match in timestep 0, then diverge. May 27 update: also true for Bocaccio in CCA, the interim numbers at age drop to 0.

June 7: `calc_Z` seems incorrect when compared to outputMort.txt; stepping through code needed

June 11: fixed matching of recruitment to timestep, still seems off

June 13: I think we have the best `calc_Z` we are going to get. After discussion with Beth, we should not expect to match output of Mort.txt because M gets rescaled so much. However, the comparison looks reasonable now for sardine and even for NOBA cod.

<a href="https://sgaichas.github.io/poseidon-dev/TestCalcZ2.html" target="_blank">Test Z calc and compare with output mort CCA and NOBA - June 7, 2019, updated June 13 and December 11 with M</a>

Dec 11: Our calculated Z is less than the input F. Does Atlantis rescale F?

June 14: fixed a bug and `calc_stage2age` works better now that it is using Z, and now that Zs are in the right ballpark. Still not a perfect match to true age output.

<a href="https://sgaichas.github.io/poseidon-dev/TestCalcStage2AgeNOBA.html" target="_blank">Test stage to age calculations and compare true age output NOBA - June 14, 2019</a>

June 15: while the age splitting is functioning better, applying it to a species with more than 2 ages per age class (CC Bocaccio rockfish) shows that our application of an annual Z estimate may not be the best approach. The functions themselves could use further tweaking.

Overall it is advisable to use true age output from more recent Atlantis codebases where possible.
